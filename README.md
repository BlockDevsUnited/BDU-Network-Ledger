# BDU-Network-Ledger
The BDU Network Ledger (BNL), is an updatable record of all communities that are members of the BDU Network.

Currently, the ledger contract is owned by a single address, which is operated by a gnosis safe controlled by the members themselves.

The owner can
  - add new members
  - activate members
  - deactive members
  - update member information

Members can
  - update their own information
  - deactivate themselves

The contract is upgradable at the behest of the owner. This is a work in progress.
